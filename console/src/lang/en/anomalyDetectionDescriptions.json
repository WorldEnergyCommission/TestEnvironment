    "overview": "This algorithm trains on historical sensor data, after training new samples are compared to the trainings-data and than graded with an Anomaly-score between 0-100. An anomaly-score of 0 means the data is behaving normally. A value of 100 indicates a highly abnormal behaviour of the observed data. Usually a score above 15 means that an Anomaly has been observed, but this also depends heavily on the sensor data.",
