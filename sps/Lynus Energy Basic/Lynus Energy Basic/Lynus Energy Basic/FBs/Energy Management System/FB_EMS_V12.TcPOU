    <Implementation>
      <ST><![CDATA[//Creator : Stefan Lackner
//Company : EfficientIO
//Date : 20.03.2024
//Version : 1.2.0.0
//With this FB the EMS control can be realized on the PLC. 
//This divides the excess energy among the devices according to priority
//Devices with priority 0 received as target power 0
//If we have less or no surplus, then the target power will be reduced or remains on the same value
//The EMS function can handle batterie devices, controllable devices, On/Off devices and step switched devices. 
//If we have no surplus, and all devices has a target power from 0, then the battery try to balancing the consumption.
//This depends what operation mode is active
//If the mode load managemant is active, for the charging station the max power from the fuse is neccessary, because the ems dont can use all the power from the max. grid power for the charging stations.  
//When a Batteryinverter or Batterysystem is in Island mode, then ems send to this system automatic -100%. The rest must be regulate the function from the batteryinverter. 
//All other battery inverters or battery systems that do not do islanding are treated by the EMS as normal devices with their priorities.
//This EMS can handle 5 device types (Battery, Heating Pump, Electric heating element, Electric charging station and other big consumers)
//This Function receive also Data from a Backend System. In this Backend System runs different ML-Models.
//So its possible that the Backend System controlls the Heating Pumps when its neccessary and also the discharging from the Batterys.
//This make sense when we have bad wheater, less PV-power in the next 24h to switch on the Heating Pumps or cover the consumption.......
//This EMS Function work only with our Backend Communication Library. After 11 Days no communication to our Backend system or no received new HB the Function dissable automatically and set a Message for this at the output
//When we receiven no HB, no Backend Service Ready Flag or an Error from the Backend Service then the Controlling over the Backend is dissabled and the EMS Function run in his "normal" Mode.

//NOTE for diNr.....Designation => 
//_IN = Here Data come in from other Functions or go out to other functions about the GVL
//_OUT = Here Data go out to other functions about the GVL


// V1.1: 	Added Zero power regulation. Used for CS do use full battery power and then Grid Power
// V1.2: 	Added Operation Mode 4: Adaptive Self Consumption: According to the Battery SOC the operation mode gets switched between self consumtion (EMS mode 1; SOC above setpoint) and load management (EMS mode 3; SOC belwo setpoint) 
//			Operaiton handled via Inpout eOperationMode_Ext 
// 			Added option for disable charging the battery (e.g. for only charging in the night) (b_EnableBatteryChargingControl, b_EnableBatteryChargingControl,b_StartReleaseBatteryCharging,b_StopReleaseBatteryCharging)
// 			Added rMaxBattChargingPower for limiting the maximum battery charge power in percent
//			Made rPeakDetectionforCalculation as input, default 3. This allows different reaction speed of the regulation
